# 🧱 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project  

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse & Analytics Project** — a hands-on implementation that explores how to design, build, and analyze a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server**.  

This project demonstrates the **complete data workflow** — from data ingestion and transformation (ETL) to data modeling and analytics visualization.  
It’s part of my personal **learning journey** to strengthen my skills in **data engineering and analytics**, while applying **industry-standard practices** used in real-world systems.
